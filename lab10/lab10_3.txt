1. In this case, the confusion matrix would show which numbers were misclassified, as a different number.
The most common mistakes are 8's being classified as 2 or 5's and 9's and 9's and 4's.

2. Keras has a neural network framework while, tensor flow is an open source library for various machine learning tasks.

classifier = train_nn_classification_model(
    learning_rate=0.05,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=30,
    hidden_units=[100, 100],

Final accuracy (on validation data): 0.95
Accuracy on test data: 0.95

3. For 10 steps the visualization is a lot more grainy then for 1000.
