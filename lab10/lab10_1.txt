1. I prefer keras because it is more intuitive and easy for new users to figure out.
In contrast, tensorFlow provides more potential functionality, but you need to know how to use it.

2.
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)


Final RMSE (on training data):   103.56
Final RMSE (on validation data): 103.04
Final RMSE (on test data): 101.32
