a. A linear model could be preferable for simple problems that won't exhibit any non-linear behavior.
These models are also faster to train then neural networks.

b. Overall, the neural net 'seems' to perform better then the linear model. The linear model has values
of 0.78 for the accuracy of both the training and testing data. While the neural net has accuracy values
of 0.92 for the training set and 0.8 for the testing set. However, the difference of 0.02 between the two
testing sets is not that significant. However, the 0.12 between the testing and training sets for the neural net
suggest that we are seeing over fitting.

c. Overall, the embedding didn't seem to have much of an effect. The accuracy for the training and testing sets
remained 0.78

d. The words "enjoyed" and "loved" are very close to each other, and they both have very positive meanings.

e. The best hyperparameters were found using all of terms in the vocab file, using [25,25] hidden units and training
the model with 5,000 steps. The resulting accuracies were 0.92 for the training set and 0.86 for the testing set.
