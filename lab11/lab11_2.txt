a. There seems to not be any missing features. But some data skew can be expected as the ratio of men to
women seems to be 2/3 men. In addition, 92% of capital_gain and 95% of capital_loss is reported as 0. This
may suggest an error at some point in the data collection or data editing process.

b. I binned marital status with the gender being the color by feature. You can see the effects of the bias clearly
because it looks as though the amount of men married is much higher then women. However, this is the result of an unequal
amount of collected data for men vs women.

c. done

d.
                    Precision   Recall
White               0.69        0.59
Black               0.64        0.5
Asian-Pac-Islander  0.72        0.64
Amer-Indian-Eskimo  0.58        0.52
Other               0.8         0.33

Our model seems to be skewed towards the other subgroup, but not as ideal for Amer-Indian-Eskimo group.
