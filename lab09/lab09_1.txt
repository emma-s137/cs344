1. The linear regression model approach is not very effective, as L2 Loss is used which does not do very well
with penalizing misclassifications when the output is interpreted as a probability.

2. LogLoss correctly penalizes based on "confidence errors". While, L2 Loss does not differentiate strongly between
misclassifying an example with a 0.9 vs 0.9999 probability.

3. Logistic regression is more effective then linear regression as the logloss with logistic regression is a lot
more consistent then the RMSE values seen with linear regression.

4. The AUC on the validation set was 0.81 and the Accuracy on the validation set is 0.78.
    And the hyper parameters used are learning_rate of 0.000005,
    steps of size 10000, and batch_size of 500.
