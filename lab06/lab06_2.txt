6.2 Done with Jason Klaassen

Part 1

1. Identify sloths in a picture.

2. Given a picture the program will be able to identify if there is a sloth.

3.  A success metric is the sloths being correctly identified by the model.
Success means identifying 80% of the sloths in given set of pictures.
Failure means the sloths are no better identified then a previously heuristic.

4.
The output from our model will be if there are any sloths in the picture and how many.

The output would be defined as an integer ranging from 0 to infinity.

5. The output will be immediately made available to the user.

Sorting pictures to design a sloth calendar that optimizes the number of sloths in it.

6. If we didn't use ML we would write a heuristic to identify brown blobs in images. The heuristic will give  a
better result if the blob is surrounded by green. The blob should have an arc. If there are two symmetrical
black lines on the blob the picture would be preferred (marks around eyes).

Part 2

1.a.  Binary classification, Unidimensional regression

  b.  Binary classification      - Sloth or no
      Unidimensional regression  - Number of sloths

2. Multiple images with a number designating how many sloths are in it.

3. Pictures collected from the internet.
