    "I think that introspection can give us insight into how we think. However, I think it would be extremely limited, as people are often not even sure of how they make their own decisions. I think that trying to model that same type of logic using AI would not be effective. You might be able to model a thought process, but some leaps that may seem random could actually come from someone's childhood background or some anecdote they once heard. Humans are not only driven by logic and reason, which makes it really hard to program. Which is most likely why the field of psychology veered away from introspection because it seemed scientifically unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my into psych class, we discussed a man who had the emotions portion of his brain destroyed (I believe the frontal lobe), so that he was driven by logic. However, it affected his ability to make simple decisions like picking between a red and blue pen. While many would think he would be able to make better decisions as a completely rational individual, it actually made it more difficult, as he did not have preferences to help sway his decisions. In this same way, it seems that a program that deals in many absolutes would not be able to replicate the complexity of a single thought.\n"
