    i. Is the GPS problem solver implemented as a class or as a function?
    GPS is a function.
    ii. The solver requires initial states, goal states and operators. Of what type are these objects?
    These objects are lists.
    iii. Is the mechanism recursive? If so, how does it implement its recursion?
    Yes, the gps function calls achieve_all(), which calls achieve(), which calls apply_operator(),
    which calls achieve_all(), implementing the recursion.


    i. What famous puzzle does this code model and what are the rules of that puzzle? Does the code faithfully implement the puzzle?
    This code models the monkey and banana problem and where a monkey has access to to a chair and a stick. There are bananas on the
    ceiling high enough that the monkey needs to be standing on the chair and waving the stick to knock the bananas down.

    What components does each domain action specify?
    How does the GPS mechanism solve the problem? Be prepared to specify this in detail. You can use the logging feature to print a trace of the mechanismâ€™s deliberations.
    Is this code artificially intelligent? If so, which definition (or definitions) of AI from the text does it satisfy?
    Would a monkey who/that solves the problem in the real world be displaying intelligence?
