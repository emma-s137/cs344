    i. Is the GPS problem solver implemented as a class or as a function?
    GPS is a function.
    ii. The solver requires initial states, goal states and operators. Of what type are these objects?
    These objects are lists.
    3. Is the mechanism recursive? If so, how does it implement its recursion?
    Yes, the gps function calls achieve_all(), which calls
